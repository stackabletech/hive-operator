== Probe error 'Thrift Error' while using Kerberos authentication
In Hive 4.0.1 with Kerberos enabled, health checks cause excessive error logs:

[source]
----
ERROR [Metastore-Handler-Pool: Thread-65] server.TThreadPoolServer: Thrift Error occurred during processing of message.
----

This is because the health check doesnâ€™t complete SASL authentication. The error is ignorable, though it can be hidden with the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  metastore:
    config:
      logging:
        containers:
          hive:
            loggers:
              org.apache.thrift.server.TThreadPoolServer:
                level: NONE
----

NOTE: This will suppress all logging from TThreadPoolServer, including log events that might be useful for diagnosing issues.
