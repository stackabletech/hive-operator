= Graceful shutdown

You can configure the graceful shutdown as described in xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[].

== Hive metastores

As a default, Hive metastores have `5 minutes` to shut down gracefully.

The Hive metastore process receives a `SIGTERM` signal when Kubernetes wants to terminate the Pod.
After the graceful shutdown timeout runs out, and the process still didn't exit, Kubernetes issues a `SIGKILL` signal.

However, there is no acknowledge message in the log indicating a graceful shutdown.
