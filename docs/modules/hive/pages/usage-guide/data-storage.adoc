= Data storage backends

Hive does not store data, only metadata. It can store metadata about data stored in various places. The Stackable Operator currently supports S3 and HFS.

== [[s3]]S3 support

Hive supports creating tables in S3 compatible object stores.
To use this feature you need to provide connection details for the object store using the xref:concepts:s3.adoc[S3Connection] in the top level `clusterConfig`.

An example usage can look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
clusterConfig:
  s3:
    inline:
      host: minio
      port: 9000
      accessStyle: Path
      credentials:
        secretClass: simple-hive-s3-secret-class
----


== [[hdfs]]Apache HDFS support

As well as S3, Hive also supports creating tables in HDFS.
You can add the HDFS connection in the top level `clusterConfig` as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
clusterConfig:
  hdfs:
    configMap: my-hdfs-cluster # Name of the HdfsCluster
----

Read about the xref:hdfs:index.adoc[Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS] to learn more about setting up HDFS.
