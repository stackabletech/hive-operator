= Getting started

This guide will get you started with Apache Hive using the Stackable Operator. It will guide you through the installation of the operator, its dependencies and setting up your first Hive metastore instance.

== Prerequisites

You will need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* optional: Helm

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM

== What's next

The Guide is divided into two steps:

* xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[Installing the operators].
* xref:getting_started/first_steps.adoc[Setting up the Hive metastore instance with PostgreSQL and Minio].
