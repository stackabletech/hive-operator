=== Hive 4 issues

Hive 4 has known compatibility issues, especially when using it with Iceberg or Trino.
The missing compatibility with Iceberg also means that Spark jobs using this storage may fail.

**Workaround:** If you encounter issues with Hive 4, use Hive 3.1.3 instead until these upstream issues are resolved.
